# SQL-querys-with-PHP

This is a PHP script I wrote which takes data (in this case an id number) submited on a html page and forms a SQL query based on the data, it then sends this to a database and displays the results returned on the web page. 

Important: I made this system intentionally vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. If you want to use this code make sure you validate input before submitting it to the database.
